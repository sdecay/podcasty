Something with an uncreative name I'm fooling with to practice Go.

Following a tutorial because I'm still uncomfortable with the language and best practices. Also I'm a bit tired of reading dry documentation and can't decide on a book to get.

Then I'll do my own thing with it. So far there's a lot I'd change.

Maybe a simple and ugly htmx frontend too.

_pressly/goose_ is pretty neat and makes things easy compared to when I did database work. Maybe too easy. At least you get to write your own queries. The code generation just kinda weirds me out a bit.

I have no idea where _sqlc-dev/sqlc_ is getting its magic values from but I haven't done anything but skim the docs because I can't read. Still kinda like it.
Also, concurrency time! Hope this is easier than silly pthreads.
